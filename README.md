# CS430-RayCaster
CS 430 Project 2: Raycasting

The following issues are present in this implementation:
- The image gets distorted when the dimensions are not square
- The program cannot handle larger image sizes (e.g. above 500x500)


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
- Navigate to the directory in console
- Call "make"
- Use the following command pattern to run:
./raycast.exe width height input.json output.ppm


I could not figure out how to get the "./" or the .exe to disappear from the required pattern.

A sample json input file of my creation has been included as well as the image it produces.
